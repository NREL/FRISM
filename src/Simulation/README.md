# List of inputs and outputs
## Running Household E-commerce Generation Estimation model for End-Consumer Behavior Module:
Note: TODO-Kyungsoo: what file formats are needed for each input?
1. Need to select models (W,O,D,WOD)Please make sure if you select models you want to run. with selection of models (W,O,D,WOD)
2. Please check "config.py" in the working directory. If you change selected variables used in the model, please copy and paste "config.py" to Simulation folder
3. This only needs to estimate, calibrate, validate models to simulate the E-commerce.
4. Once the models are fully estimated, you don't need to run this again for the simulation.

## Running End-Consumer Behavior Module to simulate monthly delivery frequency
Note: TODO-Kyungsoo: what file formats are needed for each input?
1. Key inputs: Synthetic population of household and person which comes from BEAM-CORE passenger model
2. Key inputs: models(*.sav) estimated from "HH_ecom_models.py"
3. Please check "config.py" in the working directory.

## Running Distribution Channel to simulate B2B/B2C daily shipments and shipment-carrier matching
Note: TODO-Kyungsoo: what file formats are needed for each input?
1. Key inputs: Synthetic population of household and person which comes from BEAM-CORE passenger model
2. Key inputs: models(*.sav) estimated from "HH_ecom_models.py"
3. Please check "config.py" in the working directory.

## Running Carrier Operation to simulate tour-plan for each carrier
1. scenario year
2. Travel time matrix in '.csv.gz' format (TODO: add link to example file)
3. Origin-Destination distance matrix in '.csv' format (TODO: add link to example file)
4. Dataframe of geo locations considered in '.geojson' format (TODO: add link to example file)
5. Carrier, payload and vehicle '.csv' files generated by the previous step. (TODO: add link to example file)
